# Cocktails

Welcome to the interactive cocktails CLI gem. If you would like a list of the worlds most popular cocktails, run 'bundle install' (nokogiri can take a while to load), then run `bin/cocktails` in your console for an interactive prompt.

You can select which number of cocktail you would like to learn more about. If you are having problems viewing the gem, try running 'bundle install' in your console.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cocktails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cocktails

## Usage

In terminal type: "bin/cocktails" and select the drink number you would like more information on. Upon selecting, your terminal should display a description of the cocktail, along with the basic recipe and ingredients for you to try on your own.

## Development
